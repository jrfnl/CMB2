* Check if - when no fields are added to comments - the styles & scripts load.
If so:
- make the cmb2_enqueue_css/js filters object type specific
- potentially wrap them in has_filter checks
- do the 'are we on a relevant page' check in the actual function for enqueueing (see conditionals)
- and apply the filter based on the type of edit page/object (see conditionals)
